The '10k dream' is a reference to an old server statistic that supposedly calculated that this discord server gets 10,000 messages per day on average, something which doesn't seem to be happening right now. So we have committed ourselves to fulfilling 'the dream', and breaking through that 10,000 message/day ceiling, one message at a time.
