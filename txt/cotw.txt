:bow_and_arrow: **Challenge of the Week** :bow_and_arrow:
The Challenge of the Week (COTW) is a Habitica challenge voted on by the community, that changes every week.
This can be a challenge that can ask you to do anything; make a reading habit, exercise every day, stay hydrated - but it's all done in the name of self-improvement and building yourself up.
New challenges will be posted to #challenge-of-the-week every Monday, so make sure to check out the provided link to sign up for the challenge!
