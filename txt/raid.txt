:tomato: **Pomodoro Raids** :tomato:
This is a group activity known as 'Raiding' where members of KOA all join a synchronised timer (<https://cuckoo.team/koa>) and do productive work together, using the Pomodoro Technique.
A lot of people find it easier to work knowing that other people are working 'with them', and it definitely fosters some community spirit between members that join.
